# Employee-Turnover-Analytics using machine learning

This project aims to predict employee turnover using machine learning techniques. Given employee data, the goal is to identify patterns that influence attrition and develop a predictive model to classify employees into different risk zones based on their probability of leaving. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), handling class imbalance using SMOTE, model training and evaluation, and proposing retention strategies based on predictions.
